<p>As a teenager in New Jersey, Mohammad Damra always wanted to become an aerospace engineer, and with his high-school graduation impending, he’d planned to soon pursue that ambition in college. That was before two Boeing aircrafts crashed into the Twin Towers in Lower Manhattan on September 11, 2001.</p>

<p>When it emerged those behind the attacks had been Arab and Muslim men who had attended U.S. flight schools, Damra immediately abandoned his dreams.</p>

<p>“It felt not wise to go into that career path and to put myself in that situation out of fear,” he said.</p>

<p>If he felt afraid, it was because after the attacks, Arabs and Muslims – even those who were American like Damra – were immediately regarded with suspicion. The son of Jordanian immigrants, Damra grew self-conscious about his name and Arab and Muslim identities, which overnight seemed to become the most relevant thing about him to greater American society.</p>

<p>At the same time, he was also discovering as he completed his college applications —which required that he tick a box identifying his race— that he was considered “white.”</p>

<p>“But my name is Mohammad,’” said Damra, who saw his ethnic and religious identities being portrayed after 9/11 as the enemies of the United States. For him, the vitriol directed at those identities, which pundits and politicians claimed were inherently evil and hateful, cast people from Arab origins or who practiced Islam as a racial other, and most definitely not as “white.”</p>

<p>Yet for decades, the U.S. Census Bureau has shoehorned people with ethnic and racial backgrounds from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) into the “white” category, regardless of how they are perceived or prefer to self-identify.</p>

<p>But, like Damra, many people from those regions feel that the way they are officially labeled fails to mirror their lived experience, particularly in a post-9/11 United States.</p>

<p>The call for having MENA as a separate category on the census and other questionnaires has been recurrent for years, with the U.S. Census Bureau stirring up the debate everytime it conducts its decennial survey. However, despite the growing demand from advocacy groups, the 2020 Census was no different.</p>

<p>When given the option, the majority of people from the MENA region —particularly those who are Muslim and who are first generation Americans— prefer to identify as Middle Eastern or North African, a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2117940119">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) study</a> found last February. The study also showed that the majority of white people didn’t consider those groups to be white either.</p>

<p>“I’m Middle Eastern,” said Damra, who is now 37 and a cancer biology researcher living in Philadelphia. “I don’t consider myself white at all. White people don’t even consider me white, but, according to the United States Government, I am white. How does that work?”</p>

<h2>How Arabs Became “White”</h2>

<p>Race data is a key factor in policy research, not least for civil rights, but the government also uses it to plan and fund programs that provide public services, which is why the U.S. Census Bureau has been collecting race data in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards.</p>

<p>The Office of Management and Budget first added the Middle East and North Africa in the “white” category in 1977, when it issued  <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/populations/bridged-race/directive15.html">Directive 15</a>, officially recognizing four races (American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, and White) and two ethnicities (Hispanic and non-Hispanic).</p>

<p>But the question of whether Middle Eastern and North African people are “white” dates back to the start of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The first wave of immigration from Arabic-speaking countries to the United States occurred as early as the 1870s, with a Christian majority coming mainly from modern day Syria, Lebanon, and Israel/Palestine. While they established one of America’s biggest Arab settlements in Little Syria in downtown Manhattan, they spread out to every state in the nation by virtue of the work that many of them did —peddling.</p>

<p>The second wave of immigrants, bearing a larger number of Muslims, began in the mid-1960s, following the  <a href="https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1951-2000/Immigration-and-Nationality-Act-of-1965/">Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965</a>, which abolished the National Origins Formula that barred immigrants from outside Western Europe from entering the United States.</p>

<p>During the early 1900s, newcomers had to petition for citizenship under naturalization laws that only enabled “free White persons” to obtain U.S. citizenship. In order to become citizens, Arab immigrants had to argue their whiteness in court. Their cases reflect the greater uncertainty in American society as to what “white” exactly meant, with courts variably passing judgment on it depending on whether race was interpreted as a matter of geographical origin or skin color.</p>

<p>In 1909, <a href="https://cite.case.law/f/174/735/">Costa George Najour</a>, a “Syrian from Mt. Lebanon near Beirut,” was the first Arab to do so, arguing in a Georgia court that being Caucasian was about race rather than color. Citing ethnologist A. H. Keane’s The World’s People, which classified Syrians as Caucasians, the judge found that Najour was indeed a Caucasian, given that there were “white and also dark” Caucasians. That same year, <a href="https://annualsurveryofamericanlaw.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/69-1_beydoun.pdf">George Shishim</a>, another immigrant from Mt. Lebanon, successfully petitioned for citizenship in the Los Angeles Superior Court, pleading that if he were “Mongolian, then so was Jesus, because we came from the same land.”  <a href="https://www.arabamericanhistory.org/archives/dept-of-justice-affirms-arab-race-in-1909/">In many cases</a>, immigrants from the Levant were considered Mongolian, since they came from the Asian continent.</p>

<p>Other petitioners still had their petitions denied.</p>

<p>In 1914, <a href="https://cite.case.law/f/205/812/">Faras Shahid</a>, also Levantine, failed to argue for his whiteness when District Judge Smith of South Carolina found that, “in color,” Shahid was “about that of walnut, or somewhat darker than is the usual mulatto of one-half mixed blood between the white and the negro races.” In <a href="https://cite.case.law/f/213/355/">another case</a>, the same district judge observed that Levantine complexions were of a “yellowish tinge more characteristic of the Turk and Mongol.”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1525/9780520943469-008/pdf">lynching of Nola Romey</a>, a Syrian immigrant, in 1929 in Florida served as “a terrible reminder that the whiteness of Syrians was inconclusive,” wrote Sarah Gualtieri, a Middle East and American Studies professor at the University of Southern California, in her book, Between Arab and White.
</p>

<p>But even when whiteness was no longer a racial prerequisite for naturalization, Arabs remained legally “white,” even as the notion of whiteness became less definite in an increasingly multicultural United States.
</p>

<p>Decades later, in 1997, the Office of Management and Budget released a <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards">revision</a> of Directive 15, in which “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander” was added as a fifth race, separate from Asian, after receiving thousands of complaint letters demanding a distinct classification of Native Hawaiians. In the same revision, though, the office rejected the addition of Middle Eastern and North African as its own category, even in the face of the “several comments” that “were received in support of having a separate category in order to have data viewed as necessary to monitor discrimination against this population.”</p>

<h2>‘I Don’t Select White, Because I Don’t Have the Privilege of a White Person’</h2>

<p>Yucef Jacem, a 26-year-old Kuwaiti immigrant living in New York City, came to the United States in 2014.</p>

<p>“Every time I enter the United States, except once, I would be taken into a private room, where they would ask me questions,” said Jacem, who works for an advertisement agency and as a photographer in his free time. He recalls the time he was traveling from Orlando to Kuwait, and an officer, who at first seemed amiable, was telling a joke to the person in front of him.</p>

<p>“When it was my turn,” Jacem told me, “he said something like, ‘I hope you had fun in Disneyland.’ Then he said, ‘Oh, wait a minute. Where are you from?’”</p>

<p>The officer checked his passport.</p>

<p>“He saw that I’m from Kuwait, and said, ‘Oh, evil devil!’ in a very low voice.” Jacem recounted. “These experiences are not going to happen to a white person.”</p>

<p>Jacem said he usually selects “some other race” when filling out the census and other surveys. He even considered checking off “Asian” once, since Kuwait is in Asia, “but I know that ‘Asian’ represents something different,” he said. Even as a number of his friends advised him to identify as white on job applications, suggesting it might give him an advantage over other candidates, Jacem objected to the idea, maintaining that he doesn’t look like what most Americans imagine a white person to look like.</p>

<p>“Most people would see me as an Indian, or if I’m in a deli they would see me as a Yemeni, or if I’m with Hispanic people they would see me as a Latino or Hispanic,” Jacem said. “I don’t select ‘white,’ because I don’t have the privilege of a white person.”</p>

<p>Mustafa Abban, a 24-year-old Libyan-American software engineer, said he too was pressured by his family to identify as white in applications.</p>

<p>“My family’s perspective was that I shouldn’t say I’m African, because that puts me at a disadvantage,” Abban said. “They would say, ‘ say you’re white, because then schools would want to accept you,’ but I always felt that it was disingenuous.”</p>

</figure>

<p>Abban grew up in Libya after his parents moved back there shortly after his birth in Houston, Texas. To this day, he struggles to explain his identity to others, “especially Americans that grew up here,” he said. Abban said he doesn’t feel Middle Eastern, let alone white, but rather feels specifically North African.</p>

<p>“My family goes back several generations in that area,” he said. “That’s the most honest representation of myself. If it was in a broader scope, I would identify as African.”</p>

<p>People usually assumed he was Dominican or Yemeni, he added, but never white.</p>

<p>“I would be surprised if people assumed I was white,” he added. “I don’t know how I could pull that off.”</p>

<p>Vivian Aly, a 23-year-old naturalized American from Egypt, also thought she could identify just as North African at first. She and her family came to the United States in 2001, and her experiences in school were particularly scarring.</p>

<p>“When I moved to the United States, people would treat me disrespectfully or make ignorant comments that I’m a terrorist,” said Aly. “They made a joke to try and pull my hijab off. They would assume that I came from a desert and had a camel, that Egypt had no electricity or water.”</p>

<p>Other times, Aly said, people would express surprise when they only knew her by name initially.</p>

<p>“Vivian is a white name,” she said. “If I end up going for a job interview, for example, people would make the assumption that they’re going to be talking to a white American woman.” Many told her that without her hijab, “they would just think I’m a white girl.”</p>

<h2>Beyond Mere Representation</h2>

<p>But the classification of Middle Eastern and North African people as “white” is not merely a matter of labeling. Added to what they see as a means of identity erasure, their current categorization has far-reaching implications when it comes to data collection and the issues affecting their communities.</p>

<p>It impacts their access to government allocations and other resources, including healthcare, minority benefits, as well as impacts their ability to be politically represented, and to address economic disparities. Because MENA people are lumped in with a bigger group, they are rendered statistically invisible.</p>

<p>“For the communities to really be able to receive the support they need, they have to be counted,” said Maia Dillane, director of research at the Arab American Family Support Center, a social-services nonprofit based in Brooklyn, New York. “It's equally about self-determination and identity as it is about the practical allocation of resources and enhancing equity within communities that, as we know both anecdotally and through data, have unique experiences from other communities they're lumped with.”</p>

<p>Dillane said there were many factors that intersect among community members seeking help, citing poverty and immigration status, among other things.</p>

<p>“That intersection is key to understanding their needs and specific disparities,” Dillane said. “But the lack of information makes it difficult to quantify that.”</p>

<p>For decades, the Arab American Institute, a D.C.-based Arab-American advocacy group, has been lobbying for the addition of a Middle Eastern or North African category to the U.S. census for the same reasons, citing a historical undercount of Arab Americans. (The Census Bureau estimates that there are 2.2 million Arab Americans in the United States, while the Arab American Institute found that the number is as high as 3.7 million at least.)</p>

<p>In 2015, the Census Bureau <a href="https://www2.census.gov/cac/sac/meetings/2016-10/2016-csac-jones.pdf">tested</a> whether to include a Middle Eastern or North African category, which “was found to be an effective way to improve data collection,” said Maya Berry, the executive director of the Arab American Institute.</p>

<p>“I really thought we had it for 2020,” Berry added. “But that was an extraordinary period for our country, and the category was <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018/2020-race-questions.html">abandoned</a> without explanation by the Trump Administration.”</p>

<p>According to the 2020 census, <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/improved-race-ethnicity-measures-reveal-united-states-population-much-more-multiracial.html#:~:text=About%2027.9%20million%20people%20(8.4,people%20(6.2%25)%20in%202010.">almost 28 million people identified as “some other race</a>,” making the category the population’s second-largest alone or in combination race group.</p>

<p>“If you’re collecting data and the second-largest category was ‘some other race,’ you know that your system is flawed,” said Berry.</p>

<p>The Arab American Institute is not proposing a change in the five racial categories, though. Instead, they are seeking the addition of a MENA box under ethnicity, which Berry said was on track for the 2030 census.</p>

<p>“When people talk about this, they talk about how Arabs are not white, and that’s not accurate,” said Berry. “Because Arabs are white, but Arabs are also Black and also Brown. We are an ethnic community, very much like Latinos, who can be of any race.”</p>

<h2>‘Where Are You Really From?’</h2>

<p>But even if it gets a separate category, the “Middle East and North Africa” would encompass more than one ethnicity, including not just Arab but Kurdish, Armenian, Berber, and Persian, among many others. (The term MENA is increasingly contested as a vestige of colonialism, and <a href="https://aapirc.ucsc.edu/swana/what-is-swana.html">advocacy groups</a> are seeking to replace it with South West Asia and North Africa or SWANA.)</p>

<p>“I personally have my conflicts and hesitations with both,” said Kal Shalash, a 30-year-old Palestinian-American teaching artist living in Chicago, about the two acronyms. “They try to group a lot of communities together that are very diverse and have different ethnicities within them, histories, and cultures.”</p>

<p>As a Palestinian, Shalash said that not having an accurate way to officially self-identify “doubles down on the Zionist mission to make sure that we don’t exist.” “Obviously, Palestinian will not be its own box. I wish we didn’t have to identify at all. But for me, it’s more about trying to identify as much away from whiteness as possible, and the existing form is doing the opposite.”</p>

<p>Even if they selected white, Kal added, their legal name, Khaled, “would be contradictory.”</p>

<p>Rania Mustafa, a Palestinian-American who is also part Venezuelan, said she prefers to identify as Arab, rather than Latina or even MENA at large, since the latter would officially include countries like Israel, Turkey, and Iran, who speak different languages.</p>

<p>For an alternative, she selects “other” on official surveys, but that’s hardly a solution.</p>

<p>“I remember in college, I was very specific about selecting ‘other,’ and that actually was something more in my favor, because a lot of colleges were looking for diversity,” said the 30-year-old who now heads the Palestinian American Community Center in Clifton, New Jersey. “But even when I check off ‘other,’ it feels like I’m not included. I’m just the other.”</p>

<p>Mustafa said she “never felt like I belonged” in the United States, even though both she and her father were born there. Because she wears the headscarf, she said, people associate stereotypes with her.</p>

<p>“I know when I meet people it’s the first thing they see,” Mustafa said. “A lot of people ask me where I’m from as soon as they see me. I say I was born and raised in New Jersey, and, depending on whom I’m talking to, they say, ‘Oh! But where are you really from?’”</p>
